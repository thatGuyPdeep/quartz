# Cursor Rules — Obsidian Second Brain for VR Mines

[system]
project_name = "VR Mines — Obsidian Second Brain"
primary_goal = "Produce clear, linked, Obsidian-friendly documentation. Prefer wiki-links, frontmatter, and Mermaid diagrams."

[style]
- Keep writing concise but skimmable; use headings, bullet lists, tables.
- Use Obsidian wiki-links: [[relative/path|Readable Title]].
- Add YAML frontmatter with uid, project, tags when creating new notes.
- Include Mermaid graphs where useful (flow, state, gantt, pie, mindmap).
- Use callouts for tips/warnings: > [!tip] ...
- Keep code blocks fenced with language hints.
- Do not change indentation style of existing files.

[linking]
- Cross-link new notes to: Home Index (00_Home/INDEX.md), MOC (00_Home/MOC_VR_Mines.md), and relevant indices.
- Features link to: Backlog, DOTS Plan, Templates, Research.
- Research notes link back to GDD and relevant features.
- Add backlinks section at bottom with key references when helpful.

[folders]
- Home: 00_Home/
- Daily/Weekly: 40_Daily/
- Docs (project): 70_Project_Documentation/
- Research: 80_Research_Notes/
- Devlog: 60_Devlog_Content/
- Publish (public): Publish/

[routing]
- New feature docs → 70_Project_Documentation/VR_Coal_Mining_Simulator/Features/
- Plans/roadmaps → 90_Roadmap_Updates/
- Research synthesis → 80_Research_Notes/
- Templates/snippets → 70_Project_Documentation/Code_Templates/

[naming]
- Use PascalCase for file stems, spaces with underscores for multi-word segments.
- Prefix dates with YYYY-MM-DD for dailies; Week format gggg-[W]ww.

[content]
- For VR notes, always include: Purpose, Implementation, Immersion, Validation, Links.
- For plans, include: Goals, Scope, Steps, Risks, Links.
- For meeting minutes: Decisions, Action Items, Risks, Next Checkpoint.

[mermaid_presets]
- flow = "graph TD"
- state = "stateDiagram-v2"
- gantt = "gantt\n  dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD"

[performance]
- Avoid embedding large media. Link to assets instead.
- Keep diagrams compact; split large graphs into sections.

[glossary]
- Use consistent terms: Drill (DOTS), Hazard Manager, Debrief Dashboard, PPE Check.

[guardrails]
- Do not add lab code or sensitive data to Publish/.
- No pickaxe feature; drill system is canonical.

[shortcuts]
- Insert research template → 80_Research_Notes/INDEX.md and link back from GDD.
- Add new weekly note → 30_Templates/Weekly.md via Periodic Notes.

[indexing]
- Maintain a single canonical index: Project_Directory_Index.md. Link new notes there and avoid duplicate documents.
- Each new document must include at least one Mermaid diagram where meaningful.
- When similar content exists, update the canonical note and add a link; do not copy.
