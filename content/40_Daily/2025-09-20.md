# Daily — 2025-09-20 (Week 1, Day 6)

## Goals
- Implement `WaterLeakStart`, `WaterLevelRaise`, `WaterLevelLower`, and `PumpToggle` systems.
- Add audio bridge events for water/pump (one-shot/looping).

## Checklist
- [ ] Leak start schedules and plays ambient
- [ ] Water level raise/lower respects min/max and speeds
- [ ] Pump toggle flips state and audio
- [ ] Audio bridge plays/fades correctly

## Notes
- Consider capping periodic score ticks during lowering.
