# Meeting Minutes — 2025-09-11

## Attendees
- Prof. (PI)
- Prabhakar Deep Tirkey

## Context
- Notes captured in red ink; focus on experience-first delivery and safety simulation.

## Decisions
- Immersion quality is the primary acceptance criterion for features
- Prioritize core loop: tool handling → extraction → transport → safety checks
- Narration and feedback will be added after core loop is stable

## Action Items
- Implement penalty system for unsafe actions (drops, proximity issues)
- Integrate alarms for hazards (gas detection, collapse cues)
- Remove explosion-by-proximity; replace with graded consequences
- Add Hindi audio (multilingual) for instructions where possible
- Design 4 levels of loading and fatigue (forced break model)
- Prepare load testing plan and comfort tests

## Risks / Notes
- Voice and noise are getting mixed — redesign audio bus routing
- Keep UI minimal; rely on spatial cues and audio prompts

## Next Checkpoint
- Mid-week demo with DOTS-based drill loop + preliminary penalty feedback
