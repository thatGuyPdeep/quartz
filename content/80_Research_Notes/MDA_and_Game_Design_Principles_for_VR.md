# MDA and Game Design Principles for VR Training

## MDA Framework (Mechanics → Dynamics → Aesthetics)
- **Mechanics**: Rules, inputs, systems (ECS drill, hazards, scoring)
- **Dynamics**: Emergent behavior (risk–reward, time pressure, resource juggling)
- **Aesthetics**: Player feelings: challenge, mastery, relief, responsibility, safety confidence

### VR-Specific Mapping
- Mechanics: 6DoF interactions, embodied tools, spatial audio
- Dynamics: Physical affordances, spatial attention, proprioceptive feedback
- Aesthetics: Presence, agency, competence, calm under pressure

## Core Principles (synthesized)
- **Clarity of Goal**: Always-visible objective + why it matters (safety)
- **Meaningful Feedback**: Multisensory, immediate, proportional to action
- **Progression & Mastery**: Scaffolded modules; visible skill growth
- **Challenge–Skill Balance**: Adaptive hazards; adjustable ramps
- **Fail Safely**: Consequences without trauma; clear recovery path
- **Consistency & Affordances**: One interaction pattern per class of tools
- **Juice without Noise**: Rewarding effects that support, not distract
- **Comfort First**: Teleport defaults, stable horizons, vignette; short sessions

## Design Heuristics for VR Training
- 1m–2m readable UI; hands at natural range; no micro-aiming
- Spatialized audio for hazards; VO ducking
- Haptics: graded by mass/impact; avoid constant buzz
- Teach by doing: diegetic prompts, ghost-hands, guided grips
- Cognitive load: 7±2 → chunk tasks; proceduralize

## Applying to VR Mines
- Mechanics: ECS drill, PPE checks, gas zones, collapses, scoring
- Dynamics: Trade-offs (speed vs safety), situational awareness, triage
- Aesthetics: Confidence, vigilance, teamwork pride, mastery
