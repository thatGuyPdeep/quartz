# Gamification Frameworks for VR Training (Octalysis + Principles)

## Octalysis (Yu-kai Chou) — Core Drives
1. Epic Meaning & Calling
2. Development & Accomplishment
3. Empowerment of Creativity & Feedback
4. Ownership & Possession
5. Social Influence & Relatedness
6. Scarcity & Impatience
7. Unpredictability & Curiosity
8. Loss & Avoidance

### SafeOps Mapping
- Badges & Grades → CD2
- Scenario authoring & multiple solutions → CD3
- Team/NPC cooperation & leaderboards (local) → CD5
- Timed drills & limited oxygen → CD6/CD8
- Randomized hazards → CD7
- Mission framing: “Protect your team” → CD1

## Design Principles (synthesis)
- Goals visible and meaningful; reward competence not grind
- Progress feedback: score breakdown, heatmaps, trend lines
- Variable ratio reinforcement cautiously; avoid compulsion loops
- Social proof via instructor feedback and peer review
- Avoid extrinsic reward overshadowing intrinsic mastery

## Mechanics for VR Mines
- Achievements: Safety First, Quick Reflexes, Team Player
- Streaks: incident-free sessions (resets on major mistake)
- Skill Trees: unlock advanced drills after safety consistency
- Debrief Dashboard: actionable coaching; next best task

## Validation
- Measure learning transfer; not just in-session engagement
- A/B test reward framing (safety pride vs points)
