# Coal Mining Workflow and Machines — Research Summary

## Workflow (Underground)
1. Access and commute (rail cart, 30–60 min)
2. Reach working face of the mine
3. Continuous miner cuts coal at the seam (remote controlled)
4. Coal scooped to conveyor → shuttle car
5. Loading/unloading system (joy loader)
6. Transport to containers → shipped via vehicle

## Machines and Tools (Mapped to VR Features)
- Continuous Miner — Remote operation training; hazard zones
- Shuttle Car — Navigation and loading alignment
- Joy Loader — Loading/unloading timing and safety clearances
- JCB-type Loader — Surface loading to transport
- Hand Tools — Shovel and general handling ergonomics

## Training Objectives per Stage
- Identify hazard cues; maintain safe distances
- Follow correct sequence; minimize errors and drops
- Time-on-task optimization without sacrificing safety

## Interaction Notes
- Two-handed grips with assist joints
- Material-dependent audio/haptics (coal vs. rock)
- Penalty feedback for unsafe handling

## Open Questions
- Which steps are remote vs. in-mine for a given mine type?
- Local regulations for PPE and signage standards
