# VR Immersion Factors in Training Simulations

## Definition

**VR Immersion** refers to the psychological state where users experience a sense of "being there" in a virtual environment, leading to enhanced learning, retention, and behavioral change. In training simulations, immersion is crucial for creating realistic practice scenarios that transfer effectively to real-world situations.
