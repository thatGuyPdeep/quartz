# Storytelling & Narrative Design for VR Training

## Why Narrative in Training
- Context → meaning → memory. Stories frame tasks as consequential.
- Identity shift: trainee → guardian of team safety.

## Narrative Structures
- Mission Brief → Field Operation → Debrief (3-act)
- Micro-stories: hazard near-miss, equipment malfunction, teammate assist
- Environmental storytelling: signage, worn tools, radio chatter

## VR-specific Techniques
- Diegetic UI: clipboards, wrist panels, radios
- Spatialized VO: instructor proximity, alarms directionality
- Gaze/gesture triggers; avoid forced-camera cuts
- NPC behaviors as narrative anchors (panic → assist)

## Patterns for VR Mines
- Radio Narrative: dispatcher sets stakes; instructor guides
- Teammate Thread: NPC minor incident invites help (Team Player badge)
- Debrief Montage: replay key moments; “what good looked like” clips

## Ethics & Safety
- No traumatic realism; avoid explosions near player
- Use graded consequences; focus on learnable behaviors

## Hooks & Retention
- Episodic modules with clear arcs; cliffhanger hazards for next session
- Personal progress journal with instructor notes
