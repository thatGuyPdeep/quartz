# Daily — 2025-09-21 (Week 1, Day 7)

## Goals
- Implement `ScoreSystem` with `ScoreEvent` buffer and `MistakeSystem`.
- Implement HUD Score presenter bridge (ECS → TMP).

## Links
- [[../70_Project_Documentation/VR_Coal_Mining_Simulator/Backlog|Backlog]]
- [[../70_Project_Documentation/VR_Coal_Mining_Simulator/DOTS_Migration_Runbook|DOTS Migration Runbook]]

## Checklist
- [ ] `ScoreSystem` aggregates events and clamps ≥ 0
- [ ] `MistakeSystem` updates mistake counters
- [ ] HUD presenter reads ECS and updates UI
- [ ] Verify event flow from Drill/Water systems

## Notes
- Keep bridge logic minimal; avoid heavy per-frame allocations.
