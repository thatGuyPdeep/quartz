## Performance Targets for Quest 3

### Frame Rate
- **Target**: 72 FPS (Quest 3 native)
- **Minimum**: 60 FPS
- **Use**: Unity Profiler and Oculus Performance HUD

### Resolution
- **Recommended**: 1.0x render scale (2160x1200 per eye)
- **Your advantage**: RTX 5090 can handle higher render scales for testing

### Memory
- **Target**: < 4GB RAM usage
- **Texture streaming**: Use Unity's Addressable Asset System

## Next Steps

1. **Set up development environment** (this week)
2. **Complete Unity XR Toolkit tutorial** (week 1-2)
3. **Build your first VR scene** (week 2)
4. **Start with hand tracking basics** (week 3)

Your hardware setup is excellent for XR development - you'll be able to test at high fidelity and have plenty of headroom for complex scenes. The RTX 5090 will handle any rendering challenges you throw at it!
