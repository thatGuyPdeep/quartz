## Script

### [0:00-0:30] Introduction

**[Camera on Prabhakar, casual setup with Quest 3 visible]**

"Hey everyone! I'm Prabhakar Deep Tirkey, and I'm a Research Associate at the DeSCINED Lab at IIT Delhi. You might be wondering why I'm holding a Quest 3 and talking to a camera about learning XR development in public."

**[Show Quest 3, gesture with hands]**

"Here's the thing - I'm on a 90-day probation period where I need to prove I can deliver on a VR coal mining training simulator project. But instead of just coding in isolation, I'm documenting this entire journey through livestreams and devlogs. Why? Because I believe the best learning happens when you share it with others."

### [0:30-1:30] Why XR? Why This Journey?

**[Cut to screen showing Unity interface]**

"See, I'm not just building a game here. I'm designing immersive experiences that could literally save lives. This VR simulator will train coal miners on safety procedures - when a gas leak happens, when equipment fails, when every second counts."

**[Show some Unity XR toolkit interface]**

"My background is in cognitive science and game design. For Quest 3, I'm also migrating key systems to Unity DOTS/ECS to hit mobile VR performance while keeping the interactions believable."

**[Back to camera]**

"That's why I'm sharing this journey. Because immersive design is still so new, and we're all figuring it out together. Every bug I fix, every interaction I design, every mistake I make - it's all part of learning how to create experiences that matter."

### [1:30-2:30] This Week's Progress

**[Screen recording of Unity project]**

"This week, I focused on the foundation - setting up the XR Interaction Toolkit, planning the DOTS migration, and starting an ECS-based drill interaction."

**[Show entity authoring, subscene baking]**

"Making something feel 'real' in VR isn't about perfect graphics. It's about the tiny details — tactile cues, weight simulation, and spatial audio — tuned for the Quest 3 budget."

### [2:30-3:30] Biggest Challenge & Learning

**[Back to camera, more reflective tone]**

"The biggest shift was moving from classic OOP MonoBehaviours to data-oriented ECS. It forced me to break features into components and systems — which actually made performance and debugging clearer."

**[Show profiler and Entities Hierarchy]**

"The breakthrough was getting the drill head interaction running as entities with physics and event-driven haptics, keeping frame times stable."

### [3:30-4:30] Next Steps

**[Show roadmap or planning document]**

"Next week, I'm pushing the drilling loop further, wiring scoring and penalties into ECS, and beginning the cart/conveyor entity workflow."

**[Show some design sketches or notes]**

"The design challenge remains the same: communicate urgency and safety without overload, especially on a mobile headset."

**[Back to camera]**

"I'll be livestreaming the development process every week, sharing both the successes and the struggles."

### [4:30-5:00] Outro

**[Show Quest 3 again]**
