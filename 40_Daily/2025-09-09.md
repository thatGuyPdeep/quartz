## Agenda
- Understand a day in the life of a coal miner
- Decode tools used by coal miners and their functions
- Setup OBS for livestreaming
- Plan VR devlog and game stream on YouTube
- Test 2 VR games for interaction breakdown
- Research Demola x IITD; apply for GCI Global 2025

## What I did
- Mapped miner workflow: access → commute → operation → egress
- Catalogued tools/machines; drafted VR equivalents and learning goals
- Installed and configured OBS scenes (desktop + headset capture)
- Drafted VR devlog outline and streaming checklist
- Tested 2 VR titles; captured interaction patterns and comfort notes
- Collected information on Demola and GCI opportunities

## Key Learnings
- Two-handed tools benefit from assist joints and guided grips
- Material-dependent feedback (audio/haptics) drives perceived realism

## Next Day Intent
- Convert insights into feature backlog; start DOTS drill prototype
