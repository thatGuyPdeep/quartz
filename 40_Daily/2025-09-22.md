# Daily — 2025-09-22 (Week 2, Day 8)

## Goals
- Implement `VehicleAuthoring` + `VehicleMoveSystem` (hybrid physics acceptable).
- Map Input System actions to ECS input singleton(s).

## Links
- [[../70_Project_Documentation/VR_Coal_Mining_Simulator/Backlog|Backlog]]
- [[../70_Project_Documentation/VR_Coal_Mining_Simulator/DOTS_Migration_Runbook|DOTS Migration Runbook]]

## Checklist
- [ ] Author vehicle parameters and bake entities
- [ ] Implement movement and turning with smoothing
- [ ] Input bridge writes move/turn/trigger states
- [ ] Test in SubScene with car prefab

## Notes
- Consider starting with classic Rigidbody, then migrate to DOTS physics later.
